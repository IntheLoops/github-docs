# Writing good documentation 

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code. 

A good __cloud engineer__ uses codeblocks whenever possible. It allows others to copy and paste their codes to replicate or to research issues. For example, the following code in Ruby is in a Codeblock. 

- In markdown the codeblock is separated by three backticks. ```

```
def factorial(n)
  if n <= 1
    return 1
  else
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
  end
end

# Test the factorial function
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
puts "The factorial of #{number} is #{result}"
```
The above code in Ruby calculates the factorial of a number using the recursive function. 

- When you can you should use syntax highlighting of your codeblocks.

```ruby
def factorial(n)
  if n <= 1
    return 1
  else
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
  end
end

# Test the factorial function
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
puts "The factorial of #{number} is #{result}"
```

- Format for images is ! [name of image] and url in ( ) 
- You can't resize images directly in github flavoured markdown 
- You can use html < and specifying the width in pixels 
<img width="200px" src="https://github.com/IntheLoops/github-docs/assets/145233629/d2b12a72-5a9d-4fab-8c24-55288f6444ec" />

- Good Cloud Engineers use codeblocks for both code and errors in the console.
- If you want to show an error from the console or the terminal, you should use bash after the backticks as you're using a bash terminal.
> This is an example of an error 

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  (irb):1:in `<main>'
NameError (undefined local variable or method `undefined_variable' for main:Object)
```

## Step 2 - Use Github flavoured markdown Task lists 

Github extends markdown to have a list where you can check off items. <sup>[1]<sup/>

## Step 3 - Using emojis in Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) 
- GFM suports emoji shortcodes
  
## Step 4 - How to create a table 
| Name | bar | emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cloud | `:cloud:` | ‚òÅÔ∏è
| smile | `:smile:` | üòÑ
| thumbs up | `thumbsup:` | üëé
- Refer to the cheat sheet below <sup>[2]<sup/>

## Step 5 - Adding assets direct to Github means you can share and link direct from a folder on here. 
- use the image format ! []()
![pipe key](assets/pipe key.png)

## Step 6 - Take screenshots rather than phone photos. 
- Don't upload photos that you have taken with your phone because you can't see it properly or copy
- When you can always provide a codeblock.

## Linking to another file on Github 
- create folder with file and use []()

[Markdown Overview].(github-docs/Overview/Markdown.md).

- To add links copy and paste the url. Put a friendly name into square braces and keep url in parenthesis.
